                    <p>If we ever have a serious disagreement (let's hope we don't!), we'll try to work things out through friendly negotiation first. If that doesn't work within 30 days, we both agree to go to mediation to try and resolve things.</p>
                    <p>We'll agree on a mediator, but if we can't decide, we'll turn to a mediator from the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR). The mediation will take place in at an agreed location, and the language of the mediation will be English. We'll split the mediator's costs 50/50 and each of us will cover our own expenses.</p>
                    <p>CoCoCo Platform Ltd reserves the right to mediation, before either of us can take any dispute to court. If mediation doesn't work out after 60 days from when the mediator is appointed, then either of us can bring the dispute to court as outlined in these Terms (see section 14). Hopefully everything can be resolved amicably.</p>
