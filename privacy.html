                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
                        <p>For hosting locations outside the EU (North America and Asia), we ensure an adequate level of data protection in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To further safeguard data transferred outside the EU, we implement <strong>additional technical and organizational measures</strong> (TOMs) such as <strong>encryption and pseudonymization</strong>, alongside standard contractual clauses (SCCs) or other legally recognized mechanisms.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Storage Duration:</strong> We store your data only for as long as necessary for the performance of the contract and compliance with legal retention obligations.</p>
                    <p>After termination of the contractual relationship, we generally retain your data for <strong>3 months</strong> for potential reactivation. After that, all data will be deleted, unless you request longer retention or legal obligations prevent deletion.</p>
