                    <h2>6. Contract Duration & Termination</h2>
                    <p><strong>Subscription Terms:</strong> The agreement runs for an indefinite period and automatically renews based on your selected billing interval (e.g., monthly or annually). You can cancel at any time, with cancellation taking effect at the end of your current pre-paid billing period.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have a monthly subscription that renews on the 19th and you cancel on January 18th, your access continues until January 19th. For annual subscriptions, cancellation takes effect at the end of the 12-month period you have paid for.</p>
                    <p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> We use Stripe for payment processing. Your subscription renews automatically unless you cancel before the next billing date.</p>
                    <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Payments are non-refundable. Upon cancellation, you retain access for the remainder of your paid period.</p>
                    <p><strong>Termination for Cause:</strong> Both parties have the right to terminate the contract immediately for good cause (wichtiger Grund). For us, good cause includes, in particular, a serious breach of these Terms or default in payment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Data after Termination:</strong> We retain your data for <strong>3 months</strong> after termination to allow for potential reactivation. After this period, data is deleted unless statutory retention periods apply.</p>
